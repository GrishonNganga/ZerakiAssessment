# ZERAKI ASSESSMENT
By **Grishon Gikima**

## Description
The project contains submissions for both Java and SQL assessments. Refer to the folder `zeraki/` for java code.\
SQL code can be found in the file `education.sql`

## Setup/Usage
#### For Java Assessment
* To test my submission, start by cloning the project `git clone https://github.com/GrishonNganga/ZerakiAssessment.git`
* Navigate into the project. `cd ZerakiAssessment`
* To run the program ensure you have Java compiler on your computer.
* Compile the main file `main.java` with `javac zeraki/main.java`
* Run the compiled class with `java zeraki/Zeraki`

#### For SQL Assessment
* Ensure you have MYSQL installed on your machine.
* To create the tables and run the required query, 
    1. create the database `education` with `CREATE database education;`
    2. Select the database to use it with `use education;`
* You can now create the tables by opening the file `education.sql` and copy pasting the CREATE queries 1 by 1.
* Before running the query in the same file, ensure you have inserted data into all the tables.
* Run the last query (SELECT) found in the same file `education.sql`.


#### Under the Hood (Java Assessment)
* For the 2 tasks, I have 2 java files for each. `FindMissing.java` and `Reverse.java`
* `main.java` file contains the code for the small console application to test the code for the above tasks.
* To change inputs for the `FindMissing.java` Go to `main.java` and pass different values to the array in **line 11.**
